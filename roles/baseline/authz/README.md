# authz (within baseline role)

Purpose: Controls for `authz` aligned to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS DISAâ€‘STIG.

* These are not standalone roles; they are included by the `baseline` role via `import_tasks`.
* Each task file is guarded by `enable_*` switches in `roles/baseline/defaults/main.yml`.
* Templates are under `roles/baseline/authz/templates/`.
