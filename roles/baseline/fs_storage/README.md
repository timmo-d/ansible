# fs_storage (within baseline role)

**Purpose:** Controls for `fs_storage` aligned to **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS DISAâ€‘STIG**.

## How this folder is used
- These are *not standalone roles*; they are included by the `baseline` role via `import_tasks`.
- Each file in `tasks/` maps to a control area and is guarded by `enable_*` switches in `roles/baseline/defaults/main.yml`.
- Templates for this category live under `roles/baseline/fs_storage/templates/` and are referenced with `src: "{ '{' } role_path { '}' }/fs_storage/templates/<file>.j2"`.

## Validation
- Run **USG** (`usg audit disa_stig`, optional `usg fix disa_stig`).
- Run **OpenSCAP**; the `continuous_monitoring/oscap_scan.yml` task auto-detects the Ubuntu 24.04 SCAP datastream.
